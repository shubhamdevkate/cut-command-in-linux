Usage: cut OPTION... [FILE]...
Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -b, --bytes=LIST        select only these bytes
  -c, --characters=LIST   select only these characters
  -n                      (ignored)
      --complement        complement the set of selected bytes, characters
                            or fields
      --help     display this help and exit. 

Each LIST is made up of one range, or many ranges separated by commas.  
Selected input is written in the same order that it is read, 
and is written exactly once.

Each range is one of:

  N     N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1
  N-    from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line
  N-M   from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field
  -M    from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field
